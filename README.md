# Predicting Emotion Intensity and Addressing Class Imbalance in Micro-Expression Recognition

## Abstract
This project investigates two predictive challenges in micro-expression recognition using open-source Kaggle datasets: (1) extending traditional categorical classification to continuous emotion intensity prediction, and (2) improving recognition of minority emotion classes (e.g., fear, disgust) under imbalanced data conditions.  
By comparing regression- and classification-based approaches, and by applying imbalance-handling methods such as SMOTE, class weights, and Focal Loss, the project aims to improve both the granularity and the fairness of emotion recognition models.  
The study integrates the AI Triad (data, algorithms, computing power) and reflects critically on the role of GenAI tools (ChatGPT, STORM, Hugging Face) in accelerating reproducible, ethically responsible research.

## FAIR & CARE Principles
FAIR:
All datasets used are open-access and properly cited.
Code, preprocessing scripts, and notebooks are shared in this repository with clear documentation.
Outputs are stored in interoperable formats (CSV, JSON, PNG).

CARE:
Collective benefit: Research aims to support education and healthcare applications.
Authority to control: Dataset licensing and participant consent are acknowledged.
Responsibility: Results emphasize transparency and report limitations, avoiding misuse in surveillance contexts.
Ethics: Bias and fairness are critically evaluated, particularly regarding minority emotion classes.

## 📘 Notebooks
1. Prediction_of__Microexpression_basic_EDA_ipynb_.ipynb
Performs basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) on datasets.
Includes class distribution plots and imbalance checks.
Provides baseline evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Macro-F1, Weighted-F1).

2. Explanation_NLP_network_analysis.ipynb
Uses NLP (word cloud, keyword frequency) and network analysis (semantic co-occurrence networks) to map research themes.
Identifies central and peripheral terms in micro-expression literature.
Connects findings to broader research challenges (dataset bias, subtlety of low-frequency emotions).

## Results Summary
Baseline (ResNet18, no SMOTE): High accuracy but biased toward majority classes.
PCA + SMOTE: Lower accuracy, but better recall and Macro-F1 for minority classes (fear, disgust).
AutoML (FLAML): Best overall accuracy but less interpretable.
Logistic Regression: Competitive performance with highest interpretability.
